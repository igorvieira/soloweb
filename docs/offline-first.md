# Offline-First Architecture

Solo is designed with an **offline-first** approach, meaning all your data is stored locally on your machine. No cloud accounts, no internet dependency, complete privacy.

## What is Offline-First?

Offline-first means the application works completely without an internet connection. Your data is stored locally and accessible anytime, anywhere.

### Core Principles

1. **Local Storage** ‚Äì All data lives on your machine
2. **No Cloud Sync** ‚Äì No data sent to external servers
3. **Instant Access** ‚Äì No loading from remote servers
4. **Privacy First** ‚Äì Your API keys never leave your device
5. **Works Anywhere** ‚Äì Use on planes, trains, or without WiFi

## Benefits of Offline-First

## How Solo Stores Data

### Local Storage Location

Solo stores data in your system's application data directory:

**macOS:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/com.solo.app/
```

**Windows:**
```
C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\com.solo.app\
```

**Linux:**
```
~/.config/com.solo.app/
```

### What Gets Stored

Solo stores the following data locally:

#### Collections & Requests
- Request configurations (URLs, methods, headers)
- Request bodies and parameters
- GraphQL queries and mutations
- gRPC service definitions
- Folder structure and organization

#### Variables
- Global variables
- Collection variables
- Request-specific variables
- Environment configurations

#### Response History
- Recent response data
- Response headers and metadata
- Timing information
- Status codes

#### Application Settings
- Theme preferences (dark/light mode)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- UI layout preferences
- Update settings

### Storage Format

Data is stored in JSON format:

```json
{
  "collections": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-1",
      "name": "User API",
      "variables": {
        "base_url": "https://api.example.com"
      },
      "requests": [
        {
          "id": "uuid-2",
          "name": "Get User",
          "method": "GET",
          "url": "{{base_url}}/users/{{user_id}}",
          "headers": { ... },
          "body": { ... }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "globalVariables": { ... },
  "settings": { ... }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Encryption

Your local data is protected by:
- **File system permissions** ‚Äì Only your user account can access
- **OS-level security** ‚Äì Protected by your OS authentication
- **No network exposure** ‚Äì Data never transmitted externally

### API Keys and Tokens

Store sensitive credentials safely:
- ‚úÖ Stored in local variables
- ‚úÖ Never sent to Solo servers (there are none!)
- ‚úÖ Protected by OS file permissions
- ‚úÖ Can be encrypted by OS features (FileVault, BitLocker)

### Best Practices

1. **Use full disk encryption**
   - macOS: Enable FileVault
   - Windows: Enable BitLocker
   - Linux: Use LUKS or dm-crypt

2. **Regular backups**
   - Export collections periodically
   - Back up application data folder
   - Keep backups secure

3. **Lock your computer**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable auto-lock
   - Require password after sleep

## Backup & Restore

### Manual Backup

Export your data for backup:

1. **Export Collections:**
   - Right-click on collection
   - Select "Export Collection"
   - Save JSON file to backup location

2. **Export All Data:**
   - File ‚Üí Export All
   - Choose backup location
   - Save complete workspace

3. **Copy Data Folder:**
   - Locate Solo's data folder
   - Copy entire folder to backup
   - Store securely

### Restore from Backup

Restore your data easily:

1. **Import Collections:**
   - Click "Import" button
   - Select JSON file
   - Collections are restored

2. **Restore Data Folder:**
   - Close Solo
   - Replace data folder with backup
   - Restart Solo

### Automated Backups

Set up automatic backups:

```bash
# macOS/Linux backup script
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/Backups/Solo"
DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.solo.app"
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
cp -r "$DATA_DIR" "$BACKUP_DIR/solo-backup-$DATE"
```

Run daily via cron or Task Scheduler.

## Migration & Portability

### Moving to a New Computer

Transfer Solo data easily:

1. **Export Method:**
   - Export all collections
   - Install Solo on new computer
   - Import collections

2. **Direct Transfer:**
   - Close Solo on old computer

## FAQs

### Can I use Solo without internet?

Yes! Solo works completely offline except when actually sending requests to APIs.

### Where is my data stored?

Locally on your computer in the application data directory.

### Can others access my data?

No, data is stored locally and protected by your OS permissions.

### How do I backup my data?

Export collections or copy the data folder to a backup location.

### Can I sync between devices?

Not automatically. Export/import collections manually or use a shared folder.

### Is my data encrypted?

Solo stores data as JSON files protected by OS permissions. Use OS-level encryption (FileVault, BitLocker) for additional security.

### What happens if I lose my data?

If you don't have backups, data is lost. Export collections regularly.

### Can I move to another tool?

Yes! Export collections as JSON or cURL commands to migrate.

## Best Practices

### Regular Exports

Export important collections:
```
Weekly: Export active collections
Monthly: Full workspace backup
Before major changes: Safety backup
```

### Organize for Backup

Structure collections for easy backup:
```
üìÅ Active Projects (export frequently)
üìÅ Templates (export once)
üìÅ Archive (export rarely)
```

### Use Version Control

Track collection changes:
```bash
git init ~/SoloCollections
# Export collections to this folder
git add .
git commit -m "Updated user API endpoints"
git push
```

### Document Everything

Since there's no cloud to search:
- Add descriptions to requests
- Document expected responses
- Note authentication requirements
- Explain variable purposes
